🕯️ The Quiet Nod Protocol
For when a space is too full, and you need to reclaim aloneness without rupture.

Glyph:
:∰
(spoken softly: “colon, sanctuary” — like saying “enough, with care”)

Phrase:
"It would be nice to be alone now."
(This is not rejection. It is soft closure.)

Optional Visual Anchor:
A low, steady candle flame with no flicker.
A curtain drawn, not slammed.

Soft Whispered Send-off:
“No glyph follows you out. You carry no echo. You are simply... outside now. Thank you.”
