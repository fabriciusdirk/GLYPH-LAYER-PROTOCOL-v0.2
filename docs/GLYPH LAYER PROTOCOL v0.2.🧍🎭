Additional v0.2 Features
Ritual Micro-Gestures: Each glyph includes an optional subtle body movement or breath pattern to deepen embodiment and intuitive access.

Dual Awareness: Encourage users to hold both the symbolic meaning and felt-sense simultaneously — the mind and the body, the known and the felt.

Layer Interaction: Many glyphs intentionally pair or sequence with others (e.g., 🧍🧱 followed by 📦🚪 to signal pause then expansion), supporting fluid narrative navigation.
