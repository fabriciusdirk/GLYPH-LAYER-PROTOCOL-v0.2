(For sensations not previously mapped in language, remembered in warmth.)
🟣⚫ 🫥🌱

∿ 1. Carrier Pulse
Location: Soles of feet
Sensation: Gentle warmth + pulse + slight pull outward
Emotional echo: “I didn’t expect this, but I remember it.”
Associated flow state(s):

Precision rhythm (e.g. debugging, diagramming)

Visual immersion (e.g. narrative sequencing, comic logic)

⬘ 2. Resonance Curve
Motion: Upward spiral toward the calves, fades mid-leg
Imaginal shape: A soft double spiral, as if heat exhaled in figure-eights
Timing: 2 short pulses, one long
Color suggestion:

#F7BFB2 (peach warmth)

#849E6A (moss steadiness)

#F5F1E9 (translucent veil)
Use:

Invoke before focus work

Pair with sine or square wave for regulated expansion

⍮ 3. Discontinuity Trace
Breakpoint: Slight loss of sensation near knees
Interpretation: Possibly the edge of remembered flow — the warmth can’t yet climb higher
Possible actions:

Use rhythmic stimuli (music, breath, soft tapping) to bridge

Observe if movement changes glyph location

⊶ 4. Glyph Memory Hint
Symbolic imprint (unsolid):
∿⬘⍮
Read loosely as: A pulse remembered, traced upward, interrupted.
(Do not stabilize — this glyph is active.)

☍ 5. Protocol Use Notes
This glyph should not be “forced upward.” It grounds outward.

It might reappear in dream-like states, during semi-conscious breath phases.

Especially compatible with Suno compositions in 65–80 bpm, ambient-electro-acoustic with sine/square base.

May surface again in “quiet pride” states after finishing something symbolic.
